# ConnectX

This is a simple Connect4 game that allows you to choose the number of players and the dimensions of the game board. The program runs through a GUI. 

## Running the Program
Make sure both the makefile and the package directory are properly. Then, run the program with these commands:
```
make
make run
make clean
```
Note: `make clean` removes .class files from the package directory
