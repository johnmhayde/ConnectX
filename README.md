# ConnectX

This is a Connect4 game that I wrote for class that allows you to choose the number of players and the dimensions of the game board. The program runs through a GUI. The basic GUI files were provided as we did not make it far into Java Swing.

## Running the Program
Make sure the makefile and the package directory are both setup properly. Then, run the program through these commands:
```
make
make run
make clean
```
Note: `make clean` removes .class files from the package directory
